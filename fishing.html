        <h1>FISHING THE LITTLE RED</h1>
        <p>The Little Red River, emerging icy cold from beneath the massive dam at Greers Ferry Lake, is a premier-class trout stream. Rainbows, browns, and cutthroats are caught for 29-river miles.</p>
        <p>Brown trout running 5 to 8 pounds are common, and  a 20 to 30 punder is always possible in the river that produced the world record 40 pound 4 ounce catch.</p>
        <p>The brown trout spawning run occurs from mid-October through November, making these especially good times to fish. This popular Ozark Mountian tailwater trout stream is beautiful, running clear and cold, skirted by scenic hardwood hillsides alive with wildlife - otters, raccoons, deer, ducks, songbirds, and eagles.</p>
        <p>Stocked rainbow trout provide the bulk of the Little Red River's fish population. They love whole-kernel corn, night crawlers, cheese, and other baits. </p>

            <p>Trout are not native to Arkansas but are able to survive in the cold waters provided by the nearby dam. For this reason, all but brown trout are required to be restocked each year.</p>
            <p>Your fishing license fees help to keep our lakes and streams stocked and pristine. Remember to respect the community and do your part to keep your home away from home luxurious.</p>
            <p>You can now purchase your fishing license online directly from the <a href="https://ar-licensing.s3licensing.com/?catalogItem=Fishing">Arkansas Game and Fish Commission</a>.</p>
